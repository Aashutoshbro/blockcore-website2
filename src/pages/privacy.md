## Privacy Policy

At Blockcore, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your personal data is protected. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information when you use our Wallet, Website, and Extensions. By accessing and using our services, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

### 1. No Personal Data Collection

Blockcore is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, or process any personal information about you. Our Wallet, Website, and Extensions are built to operate without requiring access to personally identifiable information (PII).

### 2. Blockchain Transactions

When you perform transactions using the Blockcore Wallet, these transactions are recorded on a public blockchain. The nature of blockchain technology means that these records are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted. This ensures transparency and security but also means that transaction data is permanently available on the blockchain.

### 3. Use of Addresses and Servers

Your cryptocurrency addresses are essential for the functioning of our Wallet. These addresses may be transmitted to Blockcore Servers, your private server, or a community server of your choice. This transmission is necessary for conducting transactions and ensuring the proper operation of the Wallet.

### 4. Purchasing Cryptocurrency

The Blockcore Wallet integrates with third-party providers to facilitate the purchase of cryptocurrency. These providers operate independently of Blockcore and may use cookies, tracking technologies, and other methods to collect data. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of service of each third-party provider before engaging in transactions.

### 5. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

Blockcore supports Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), allowing you to create and manage your own digital identity. When you use DIDs, you have the option to publish your identifiers and associated profiles publicly. These profiles are not stored on the blockchain and can be withdrawn from public access at any time, provided you retain control of your Wallet. We advise sharing only the minimum necessary information in these profiles.

### 6. Data Vaults and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs)

Blockcore allows users to create and publish data vaults on public Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs). As the creator of a data vault, you have full control over what content is published or unpublished. Sharing content from data vaults is managed through access controls that you define. However, please note that individual hosts of DWNs may censor, filter, or delete content at their discretion.

### 7. No Tracking or Logging

Blockcore does not track or log any personally identifiable information. We do not engage in any form of activity tracking or data logging across our services. If you choose to publish personally identifiable information using our services, we cannot guarantee the ability to remove that information once it is made public.

### 8. Security of Your Data

While we do not collect personal data, we prioritize the security of the information that is transmitted through our services. Blockcore employs industry-standard security practices to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, it is important to remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 9. Links to Third-Party Websites

Our services may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated by Blockcore. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.

### 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

Blockcore reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Your continued use of our services after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.
